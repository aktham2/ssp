Stochastic shortest path optimization

using a topological sorting algorithm. complexity is O(N+E)
MDP with optimality criterion of minimal cost from source node to destination node
different MD control policies are explored. 
Markovian because all past information is incorporated into current state as the current node and current cost
		Decision rules: Optimal expectation, variance, worst case, ...
Probability distribution on the cost of each edge.
introduce action set, with a prob dist on the edge taken weighted more toward s_i for a_i
